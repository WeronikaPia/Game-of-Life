# Game-of-Life
Welcome to the Game of Life!

This program is an implementation of the well-known cellular automaton called "Game of Life". It's not a typical game as it has no players. The rules are simple:

For a space that is populated:
- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

For a space that is not populated:
- Each cell with exactly three neighbors becomes alive.

The program includes special functions that you can access by pressing the following keys:
- "SPACE" - pause simulation
- "C" - clear the board
- "R" - generate a random board

To generate particular patterns:
- "G" - glider
- "U" - Gosper glider gun
- "P" - pulsar

You can also click on cells to make them alive or dead.

Have fun!
